          The first Olympic Games took place in the 8th century B.C. in Olympia, Greece. 
            Held every four years, in honor of the Greek God Zeus, records show the Ancient 
            Olympic Games began in 776 BC in Olympia and weren't halted until 394 AD.  Then, 
            in the 4th century A.D., all pagan festivals were banned by Emperor Theodosius I 
            and the Olympics were no more.

          At its 1986 Session in Lausanne, the IOC decided to introduce a change where the summer and winter games were no longer held in the same year. 
          From 1924 to 1992, the Summer and Winter Games were each held in the same year, every four years. 
          This four years period is called the "Olympiad". The last Summer and Winter Games held in the same 
          year were in Barcelona (Summer) and Albertville (Winter) in 1992. Since then, the Summer and Winter 
          Games are each still held every four years but the Summer Games are celebrated during the first year 
          of an Olympiad and the Winter Games held in the third year.

What is less known is that the silver medallist that day was Australian white man, Peter Norman. He stood by the duo in solidarity while displaying a human rights badge. Norman was, like the two American sprinters, attacked by his own country's media for this display and barred from competing in future Olympics.

          The London 2012 Olympic Games was known as the Women's Games because it was the first summer Olympics which showcased true equality. Women were not barred from a single sport and for the first time in history, each and every nation sent a female competitor.
